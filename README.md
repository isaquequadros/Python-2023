DFS - Depth-First Search:
Depth-First Search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the root node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. The most common implementation of DFS uses a stack data structure, but there are other implementations too. DFS is often used as a building block in other algorithms, such as topological sort and shortest path algorithms.
